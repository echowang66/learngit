        ASCII was the first character encoding standard. 
        ASCII defined 128 different characters that could be used on the internet: 
        numbers (0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < > .

        ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 
        4. This character set supported 256 different character codes. HTML 4 also supported UTF-8.
        
        ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set.
         ANSI is identical to ISO-8859-1, except that ANSI has 32 extra characters.
        
        The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to
         use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!
